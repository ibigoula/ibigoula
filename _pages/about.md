Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently a fourth-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing at the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab at the TU Darmstadt, supervised by Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych. My research focuses on LLM interpretability. In particular, I'm interested in explaining how LLMs acquire complex abilities like reasoning and instruction-following.

Currently I'm working on:

* Post-training
* In-context learning
* Mechanistic interpretability

I previously obtained my M.Sc. degree at the Ludwig-Maximilians-UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen (LMU) under the supervision of Dr. Alexander Fraser. There I focused on cross-lingual transfer learning. Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. in theoretical linguistics and philosophy from the University of Florida.
